# Quant_Methods_Ray_Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to study the effect of noise levels and human interaction on the behavior of captive Cownose and Southern rays.  This project looks to investigate how rays respond to differing levels of human presence and interaction in captivity in an effort to potentially idenify optimal conditions for rays in captivity in the future.

## Data Collection
The data used for this project was collected over a one and a half month period at the South Carolina Aquarium.  A total of 28 rays (21 Cownose and 7 Southern) were observed in 15 minute trials.  For each species, the following behaviors were observed: breaching (head and fins breaking the top of the water) via 1/0 sampling at one minute intervals, peeking (head only breaking the top of the water) via 1/0 sampling at one minute intervals, and waving (fins only breaking the top of the water) via all occurrance sampling at one minute intervals.  Additionally, the number of individuals beside the pool, number of individuals interacting with the rays, and the number of individuals feeding the Cownose rays was recorded every minute within each trial.  Every minute, the maximum decibel level for that minute was recorded along with the windspeed for the entire 15 minute trial.

## Data Analysis
Utilize the following key to identify the variable names that will be combined to observe their interactions:

c = Cownose Rays

s = Southern Rays

b = breaching behavior

w = waving behavior

p = peeking behavior

feed = number of people feeding the rays during an interval

prsnt = number of people present at the side of the tank during an interval

intact = number of people interacting with the rays (with their hands in the water) during an interval

mxdb = the maximum decibel level recorded during an interval

wind = wind speed during that data collection period


The code presented here is intended to be run in order, at least initially, to ensure all variables are defined prior to use later on in the script.
