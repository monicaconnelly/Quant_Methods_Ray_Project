# Quant_Methods_Ray_Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to study the effect of noise levels and human interaction on the behavior of captive Cownose and Southern rays.  This project looks to investigate how rays respond to differing levels of human presence and interaction in captivity in an effort to potentially idenify optimal conditions for rays in captivity in the future.

## Data Collection
The data used for this project was collected over a one and a half month period at the South Carolina Aquarium.  A total of 28 rays (21 Cownose and 7 Southern) were observed in 15 minute intervals.  For each species, the following behaviors were observed: breaching (head and fins breaking the top of the water) via 1/0 sampling, peeking (head only breaking the top of the water) via 1/0 sampling, and waving (fins only breaking the top of the water) via all occurrance sampling.  Additionally, the number of individuals beside the pool, number of individuals interacting with the rays, and the number of individuals feeding the Cownose rays was recorded every minute within each interval.  Every minute, the maximum decibel level for that minute was recorded along with the windspeed for the entire 15 minute interval.
